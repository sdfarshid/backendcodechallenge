## Backend Coding Challenge 

In order to be considered for the Backend position, you must complete the following task. 

### Prerequisites

- Experience with PHP or Python, along with experience using a framework such as Symfony, Laravel, Flask, Django, etc.
- Database knowledge (MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, etc.)

## Task


* Find the 1000 most recent commits (only hashes)

* Create a model and store the 1000 most recent commits in the database. Make sure to avoid any duplicates.

* Create a route and view that displays the recent commits by author from the database. 

* Keep your solution flexible enough to be able to later on provide support for the bitbucket-api/gitlab-api, etc...

  

## Key Points We Are Looking For
* Scalable solution
* Ability to use libraries
* Ability to create a basic model and retrieve information from the database
* Use Composer
* Use Docker
* Needs to have tests
 
## Implementation and Conceptual Questions

Please answer these questions in a Markdown file and commit it to the repo.

Please use English for the answers, and you can use drawings for a better description

1. How were you debugging this mini-project? Which tools?
2. Please give a detailed answer on your approach to test this mini-project.
3. Imagine this mini-project needs microservices with one single database; how would you draft an architecture? 
4. How would your solution differ if, all of a sudden, instead of saving to a Database, you had to call another external API to store and receive the commits?
